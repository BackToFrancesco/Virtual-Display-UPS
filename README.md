# Virtual Display for Communication with UPS
This project was conducted as the final assignment for the 2021/2022 Software Engineering course, led by Prof. Tullio Vardanega at the University of Padova, in collaboration with Socomec.

## Purpose
Its primary goal was the development of a 'VIRTUAL DISPLAY'. This feature extends the human-machine interface, showcasing data and the overall status of a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) device to clients. A UPS is an electrical device designed to address sudden power supply issues like voltage drops and blackouts.

Furthermore, the aim included the creation of a “REMOTE SUPPORT”, or a REMOTE SUPPORT ON-DEMAND service that connects the client, through his mobile device, and a remote technician, allowing to provide immediate assistance and support to the client. This repository is the upload of a part of the original repository that can be found at the following link (Italian only). This repository contains the code for the VIRTUAL DISPLAY application developed in Flutter.

The project also involved creating a 'REMOTE SUPPORT' system. This on-demand service facilitates communication between the client, using their mobile device, and a remote technician. It's designed to provide immediate and effective assistance and support to the client.

This repository hosts a segment of the original project, which is available at the following [link](https://gitlab.com/byteapplesweunipd) (Italian only). It includes the source code for the VIRTUAL DISPLAY application, developed using Flutter.
