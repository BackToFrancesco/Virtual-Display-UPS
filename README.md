## Purpose
Its primary goal was the development of a 'VIRTUAL DISPLAY'. This feature extends the human-machine interface, showcasing data and the overall status of a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) device to clients. A UPS is an electrical device designed to address sudden power supply issues like voltage drops and blackouts.

Furthermore, the aim included the creation of a “REMOTE SUPPORT”, or a REMOTE SUPPORT ON-DEMAND service that connects the client, through his mobile device, and a remote technician, allowing to provide immediate assistance and support to the client. This repository is the upload of a part of the original repository that can be found at the following link (Italian only). This repository contains the code for the VIRTUAL DISPLAY application developed in Flutter.

The project also involved creating a 'REMOTE SUPPORT' system. This on-demand service facilitates communication between the client, using their mobile device, and a remote technician. It's designed to provide immediate and effective assistance and support to the client.

This repository hosts a segment of the original project, which is available at the following [link](https://gitlab.com/byteapplesweunipd/swe-project) (Italian only).
The original repository contains the documentation (requirements analysis, definition of technologies and software architecture, user manual, maintenance manual, etc.) and the code for the web app for remote support and the virtual display app.

This repository only includes the source code for the VIRTUAL DISPLAY application, developed using Flutter.
